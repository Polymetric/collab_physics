# Newtons Laws - Action/Reaction, then Inertia, then Force 
* action/reaction = push a thing and you feel the force; rockets!!
* Newton’s cradle, change variables on the fly
* Colliding objects
* Forces are a relationship between mass and acceleration.

# Gravity
* basic idea, more mass = more, more distance = less
* Things fall at the same rate cause we just learned newtons law
* Touch on orbits cause they’ll ask how the moon stays up

# Torque
* Levers - seesaw, crowbar
* catapults!
* trebuchets - torque AND Gravity!

# Kinematics ( CALCULUS CONCEPTS for days)
* GRAPHSSSSSSSS
* NOT MATH BUT GRAPHHHHHHHHSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

# Conservation of Energy
* Demonstrate balls going same height
* Demonstrate smaller ball goes higher proportional to mass
* Demonstrate 1kg of water through wheel can lift 1 kg ball to where water was
* Ramp, goes as high as it started

# Pressure/fluid, then density/buoyancy
* Compressible fluids
* hydraulic pistons - Major teaching moment, area * force
* water as a source of kinetic energy - gravitational -> kinetic
* WATER ROCKETS

# Springs maybe
